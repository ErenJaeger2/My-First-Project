### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below

```css
.round {
    margin: auto;
    border-radius: 15px;
    padding: 20px;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    position: relative;
}
```

### Continued development

Areas like containers, aligning items, the display , margins and  positions of containers are areas i would like to work on and get better at.

### Useful resources

- (w3schools.com) - This helped me in knowing how to create rounded corners, how to  align, add margins and paddings  to them. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward and would also  recommend it to anyone still  learning this  concept.
